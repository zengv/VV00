# Spatio-temporal BP for spiking neural networks.
Matlab version of convolutional SNN on MNSIT. 

Please find another branch for Pytorch version on CIFAR10 and N-MNIST (update later).

### Requirement
- Python 3.6
- MNIST dataset
- CIFAR10 dataset
- N_MSNIT dataset

### Results
After 100 epochs, it can obtain ~ 99.4% acc on MNIST.
